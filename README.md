# ostentatious-palaverer
An easy-to-program "artificial intelligence" chatbot

Have you ever wondered if you could create your own Siri? 
Well, you kinda can.
This bot can store responses, as well as grab information from Wikipedia.

However, there isn't any documentation, and the bot is coded poorly(I tried)

If you want to use it or fix it, go ahead. But if you do, please tell me. I would
love to see someone do it better than I did.

Also, the name of this repo was not randomly generated. The name, in my humble opinion, is awesome.
